add outside temp to graph
add y axis to graph
DONE- add a hot and cold day

graph that shows how the learning approaches the baseline for Temp, cost, and maybe reward.

After the model is learned, we would want to run a single day where we compare the difference between
the baseline and the learned model.

Problem statement for the intended purpose of this learning system.

List out the sources and references

Define methods and a brief description associated with the methods of choice.



notes todo

Done Change the cycle time to ten mins( then try 5 mins)
need to update the terminal rewards when it fails(negative reward if outside the bounds).

The incremental reward how much we spent during that time frame

time frame max expense, if outside make negative max expense

Demo

During demo be able to tweak values 
(hot day, cold day)
(Comfort tolerance)
(Money focus)
(Temperature focus)




occupancy reward
